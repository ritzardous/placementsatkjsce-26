# Class of 2027 / AY 2026–27 — ongoing season

- Source: owner-supplied `27batchemailthread.pdf`, 16 image-based pages, exported 8 October 2026 at 17:03 IST. Its SHA-256 is stored in `data/sources-2027/source-manifest.json`.
- All 22 result announcements were OCR-extracted and checked visually, including merged role cells and page continuations. Reviewed transcriptions are committed in `data/sources-2027/reviewed-announcements.json`; the PDF and intermediate OCR files are not bundled into the frontend.
- 121 candidate selections, 121 distinct roll numbers, 19 normalized companies. Every announcement's running TPO counter reconciles to the cumulative source rows; final counter: 121.
- Declared results span 22 July to 6 October 2026. The latest included email was sent 8 October 2026 at 14:42 IST; email receipt, result date, and export time are distinct.
- StoneX/Stonex share a company key. Tata Consultancy Services/TCS share a company key. Source display names and separate announcements remain preserved.
- Printed branch labels are retained, including AI & DS, CCE, EXCP and RAI. No branch is inferred from a roll-number prefix.
- Registration denominator is missing. Placement rate and unplaced count remain unknown; the 2026 denominator is not reused.
- Three announcements have mixed CTC: TCS Prime/Digital (9.00/7.09 LPA), KPMG DSSI/CRC-CST (6/5 LPA), and Deloitte A&A/Other (6.71/7.6 LPA). Preserve package text, exclude these announcements from single-value numerical aggregates, and do not infer individual package assignments. This excludes 52 selections from numerical CTC views.
- The merged KPMG CRC/CST cell retains both role labels together for rows 1–9; rows 10–13 explicitly say Tech Transformation - DSSI. Deloitte's Analyst role spans all 32 rows across pages.
- Transbnk `10:00 LPA` Think 360 `09:50 LPA`, and LogiNext `11:00 LPA` are transcribed as 10.00, 9.50, and 11.00; the printed strings and interpretation notes remain attached to their records.
- The overview retains announcement-weighted averages, as in the 2026 email dashboard; branch averages remain selection-weighted. Highest known single-value announcement CTC: 31.79 LPA. These calculations are not official college averages.
- The 100+ milestone poster adds no separate selections or announcement.

## Meaning of LIVE

- LIVE identifies the ongoing season, not automatic ingestion of college email.
- A persistent banner shows ongoing/provisional status, latest included email, latest declared result, and a refresh action on every 2027 section.
- Refresh loads the latest reviewed publication from cloud Firestore. New emails still need a reviewed import; no fabricated updates are generated.

## Updating and testing

1. Review new source announcements, preserve file/page references, and append or correct the transcription. Deduplicate messages/corrections; never append the same result twice. Update source manifest dates and metadata notes to the actual new coverage.
2. Run `npm run data:build-2027`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. Counter discrepancies intentionally stop the build for review; document legitimate discrepancies before changing the reconciliation policy.
3. Run `npm run db:seed -- --year 2027 --dry-run`.
4. With Admin credentials configured outside Git, publish using `npm run db:seed -- --year 2027 --project placement-stats-kjsce --allow-production`, for the first publication. For later updates, review the active version ID in Firestore `batches/2027`, then append `--expected-version CURRENT_ACTIVE_VERSION_ID` to the seed command. Activation refuses to overwrite an unexpected version; the previous immutable version remains available for a controlled rollback. Then verify using `npm run db:verify -- --year 2027 --project placement-stats-kjsce --allow-production`.
5. Open `/#2027/overview`; check the live banner, source date, counts, companies, new branch labels, candidate search, timeline, year switching, and mobile layout. `PREVIEW_YEAR=2027` is supported by `scripts/preview.mjs`; the Firebase test runner also seeds the 2027 fixture for isolated browser tests.
6. Deploy frontend changes through the existing Vercel workflow. Publishing Firestore data does not deploy the React year selector. Future data-only updates do not require a frontend rebuild unless schemas or UI change.

Keep the ongoing label until the owner supplies evidence that the season has ended; do not infer completion from inactivity.

## Verification for this addition

- All 19 unit/publication/statistics checks passed, including 2025/2026 regression checks and new 2027 reconciliation checks.
- TypeScript and production build passed. The existing bundle-size warning remains.
- Reviewed 2027 data was staged, activated, and fully reconciled in the live Firebase project using the existing immutable publication pipeline.
- All seven dashboard routes rendered against real cloud Firestore at desktop and mobile widths without browser exceptions or horizontal overflow.
- Additional cloud browser checks passed for live status/source date, exact selection totals, company links, reload, refresh, switching all three years, and absence of live labels on historical batches.
- The isolated emulator browser suite has a new 2027 workflow check and fixture seed for future CI runs; that full suite was not run for this addition. No Firestore or Storage security rules were changed.
- Frontend deployment remains through the owner's existing Vercel workflow; publishing data alone does not deploy the new React UI.
