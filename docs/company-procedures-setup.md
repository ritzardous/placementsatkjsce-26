# Company Procedures setup

The live app uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore on Spark, with a trusted Node API hosted alongside the frontend on Vercel. It does not require Firebase Cloud Functions or a Blaze upgrade. See [the current setup and remaining external steps](../4amchanges.md).

- `npm run dev`: normal app and API on localhost:5173, using real Google accounts and live Firestore.
- `npm run dev:beta`: isolated test backend and accounts on localhost:5174.
- `npm run procedures:deploy`: publish live rules/indexes/catalog and assign the chosen admin; no billing change.
- `npm run procedures:verify -- --project placement-stats-kjsce --allow-production --cli-auth`: read-only live setup verification.

The Node API reuses the tested transaction services in `functions/src/service.ts`. The Firebase Functions wrapper remains for isolated emulator testing. Production API credentials are server-only `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`; Google tokens and current account status are verified before any mutation. Private submissions, revisions, limits, votes and email outbox remain protected by the same rules.

Email delivery is optional and occurs in the app API after submission. The admin dashboard works without email. No scheduled Firebase worker is deployed on Spark; provider retry infrastructure is a separate optional setup.
